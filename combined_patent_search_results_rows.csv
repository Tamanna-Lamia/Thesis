Parameter",10000082,"Described is a painting stamp having built-in leveling features. For example, the stamp includes a stable backing with a three-dimensional form affixed with the stable backing. One or more leveling features are attached with the stable backing, such as a spirit level that is affixed with the stable backing and/or a series of holes formed through the stable backing. During operation, one would position the stamp upon a wall surface such that a bubble within the spirit level is levelled to indicate that the stamp is level. Alternatively, one could draw a level line upon a wall surface and then position the stamp upon the wall surface such that the level line can be seen through the series of holes to indicate that the stamp is level."
