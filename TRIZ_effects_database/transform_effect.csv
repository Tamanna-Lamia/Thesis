Acoustic,Acoustic,Acoustic Absorption,"The process by which a material, structure, or object takes in sound energy when sound waves are encountered, as opposed to reflecting the energy. Part of the absorbed energy is transformed into heat and part is transmitted through the absorbing body."
Acoustic,Acoustic,Acoustic Cavitation,"Cavitation induced by an acoustic field. Microscopic gas bubbles which are generally present in a liquid will be forced to oscillate due to an applied acoustic field. If the acoustic intensity is sufficiently high, the bubbles will first grow in size, and then rapidly collapse. High power ultrasonics usually use the inertial cavitation of microscopic vacuum bubbles for treatment of surfaces, liquids and slurries."

A reverberation, or reverb, is created when a sound is produced in an enclosed space causing a large number of echoes to build up and then slowly decay as the sound is absorbed by the walls and air.This is most noticeable when the sound source stops but the reflections continue, decreasing in amplitude, until they can no longer be heard."
Acoustic,Acoustic,Scattering,"A general physical process where some forms of radiation, such as light, sound, or moving particles, are forced to deviate from a straight trajectory by one or more localized non-uniformities in the medium through which they pass (includes deviation of reflected radiation from the angle predicted by the law of reflection)."

It is driven by the fact that heated water diffuses more readily than salty water. A small parcel of warm, salty water sinking downwards into a colder, fresher region will lose its heat before losing its salt, making the parcel of water increasingly denser than the water around it and sinking further. Likewise, a small parcel of colder, fresher water will be displaced upwards and gain heat by diffusion from surrounding water, which will then make it lighter than the surrounding waters, and cause it to rise further."
