Absorb,Liquid,Ostwald Ripening,"An observed phenomenon in solid solutions or liquid sols that describes the change of an inhomogeneous structure over time, i.e., small crystals or sol particles dissolve, and redeposit onto larger crystals or sol particles. Occurs because larger particles are more energetically favored than smaller particles. This stems from the fact that molecules on the surface of a particle are energetically less stable than the ones in the interior. Ostwald ripening is also observed in liquid-liquid systems, causing diffusion of monomers (i.e. individual molecules or atoms) from smaller droplets to larger droplets due to greater solubility of the single monomer molecules in the larger monomer droplets."

Absorb,Liquid,Semipermeable Membrane,"A membrane that will allow certain molecules or ions to pass through it by diffusion (and occasionally specialized facilitated diffusion). The rate of passage depends on the pressure, concentration, and temperature of the molecules or solutes on either side, as well as the permeability of the membrane to each solute."

Absorb,Liquid,Syphon,"Typically an inverted U shaped tube, which allows a liquid to flow uphill without a pump, over an obstacle and then discharge at a level lower than the surface of the original reservoir. Practical siphons operate because gravity causes the hydrostatic pressure at the downstream end of the tube to be significantly higher than the surrounding pressure so fluid flows out of the tube into the atmosphere or into a second reservoir lower than the first."

Absorb,Liquid,Wetting,"The ability of a liquid to maintain contact with a solid surface, resulting from intermolecular interactions when the two are brought together. The degree of wetting is determined by a force balance between adhesive and cohesive forces. Adhesive forces between a liquid and solid cause a liquid drop to spread across the surface.

Absorb,Solid,Colloid,"A type of chemical mixture where one substance is dispersed evenly throughout another. The particles of the dispersed substance are only suspended in the mixture, unlike a solution, where they are completely dissolved within. This occurs because the particles in a colloid are larger than in a solution - small enough to be dispersed evenly and maintain a homogenous appearance, but large enough to scatter light and not dissolve."
Absorb,Solid,Fermentation,"In an industrial context, fermentation refers to the breakdown of organic substances and re-assembly into other substances.

Accumulate,Divided Solid,Centrifugal Force,"An outward force associated with rotation. Centrifugal force is one of several so-called pseudo-forces (or inertial forces), so named because, unlike real forces, they do not originate in interactions with other bodies situated in the environment of the particle upon which they act.

Accumulate,Divided Solid,Potential Well,"The region surrounding a local minimum of potential energy.

Accumulate,Field,Angular Momentum Conservation,In a closed system angular momentum is constant. The conservation of angular momentum explains the angular acceleration of an ice skater as she brings her arms and legs close to the vertical axis of rotation. By bringing part of mass of her body closer to the axis she decreases her body's moment of inertia. Because angular momentum is constant the angular velocity (rotational speed) of the skater has to increase.

Though directly related to the photoelectric effect, the two processes are different and should be distinguished. In the photoelectric effect, electrons are ejected from a material's surface upon exposure to radiation of sufficient energy.

Accumulate,Solid,Ostwald Ripening,"An observed phenomenon in solid solutions or liquid sols that describes the change of an inhomogeneous structure over time, i.e., small crystals or sol particles dissolve, and redeposit onto larger crystals or sol particles. Occurs because larger particles are more energetically favored than smaller particles. This stems from the fact that molecules on the surface of a particle are energetically less stable than the ones in the interior.

Constrain,Divided Solid,Settling,"The process by which particulates settle to the bottom of a liquid and form a sediment. Particles that experience a force, either due to gravity or due to centrifugal motion will tend to move in a uniform manner in the direction exerted by that force. For gravity settling, this means that the particles will tend to fall to the bottom of the vessel, forming a slurry at the vessel base."

Constrain,Divided Solid,Welding,"A process for joining materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, typically by melting the workpieces and adding a filler material to form a pool of molten material (the weld pool) that cools to become a strong joint, with pressure sometimes used in conjunction with heat, or by itself, to produce the weld (in contrast with soldering and brazing, which involve melting a lower-melting-point material between the workpieces, without melting the workpieces."
Constrain,Divided Solid,Wetting,"The ability of a liquid to maintain contact with a solid surface, resulting from intermolecular interactions when the two are brought together. The degree of wetting is determined by a force balance between adhesive and cohesive forces. Adhesive forces between a liquid and solid cause a liquid drop to spread across the surface. Cohesive forces within the liquid cause the drop to ball up and avoid contact with the surface."

The conservation of angular momentum explains the angular acceleration of an ice skater as she brings her arms and legs close to the vertical axis of rotation. By bringing part of mass of her body closer to the axis she decreases her body's moment of inertia. Because angular momentum is constant the angular velocity (rotational speed) of the skater has to increase.
Constrain,Field,Birefringence,"Birefringence, or double refraction, is the decomposition of a ray of light into two rays (the ordinary ray and the extraordinary ray) when it passes through certain types of material, such as calcite crystals or boron nitride, depending on the polarisation of the light.

Constrain,Field,Dielectric Permittivity,"The measure of how much resistance is encountered when forming an electric field in a medium. In other words, permittivity is a measure of how an electric field affects, and is affected by, a dielectric medium.

For each of these, the overall thickness of the lens is decreased, breaking the continuous surface of a standard lens into a set of surfaces of the same curvature, with discontinuities between them. This reduces the thickness (and weight and volume) of the lens, at the expense of reducing the imaging quality."
Constrain,Field,Gyroscope,"A device for measuring or maintaining orientation, based on the principles of angular momentum.

Constrain,Field,Inductor,"A passive electrical component that can store energy in a magnetic field created by the electric current passing through it. Typically an inductor is a conducting wire shaped as a coil, the loops helping to create a strong magnetic field inside the coil due to Ampere's Law. Due to the time-varying magnetic field inside the coil, a voltage is induced, according to Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, which by Lenz's Law opposes the change in current that created it."

Magnetic fields also have their own energy with an energy density proportional to the square of the field intensity."
Constrain,Field,Magnetic Hysteresis,"Hysteresis phenomena occur in magnetic and ferromagnetic materials, as well as in the elastic, electric, and magnetic behavior of materials, in which a lag occurs between the application and the removal of a force or field and its subsequent effect.

Constrain,Field,Magnetic Saturation,"Seen in some magnetic materials, saturation is the state reached when an increase in applied external magnetising field cannot increase the magnetisation of the material further, so the total magnetic field levels off. It is a characteristic particularly of ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, nickel, cobalt and their alloys."

Constrain,Field,Non-Newtonian Fluids,"Fluids whose flow properties are not described by a single constant value of viscosity. In a non-Newtonian fluid, the relation between the shear stress and the strain rate is nonlinear, and can even be time-dependent. Therefore a constant coefficient of viscosity can not be defined.

Unlike other reagents that participate in the chemical reaction, a catalyst is not consumed.

Expand,Divided Solid,Ostwald Ripening,"An observed phenomenon in solid solutions or liquid sols that describes the change of an inhomogeneous structure over time, i.e., small crystals or sol particles dissolve, and redeposit onto larger crystals or sol particles. Occurs because larger particles are more energetically favored than smaller particles. This stems from the fact that molecules on the surface of a particle are energetically less stable than the ones in the interior.

Responsible for commonly observed magnetism phenomena, e.g. 'fridge magnets. A material is 'ferromagnetic' only if all its magnetic ions add a positive contribution to the net magnetisation. If some of them subtract from the net magnetisation (i.e. are partially anti-aligned), then the material is 'ferrimagnetic'."

An object with constant mass will accelerate in proportion to the net force acting upon it and in inverse proportion to its mass (or the net force on an object is equal to the rate of change of momentum it experiences). Forces acting on objects may cause them to rotate or deform, or result in a change in pressure."
Hold,Liquid,Fractal Forms,"A fractal is generally 'a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole,' a property called self-similarity. A mathematical fractal is based on an equation that undergoes iteration, a form of feedback based on recursion."

Hold,Liquid,Gel,"A gel is a solid, jelly-like material that can have properties ranging from soft and weak to hard and tough. Gels are defined as a substantially dilute crosslinked system, which exhibits no flow when in the steady-state. By weight, gels are mostly liquid, yet they behave like solids due to a three-dimensional crosslinked network within the liquid. It is the crosslinks within the fluid that give a gel its structure (hardness) and contribute to stickiness (tack)."
Hold,Liquid,Gettering,"A process for removal of impurities by reacting them with or attracting them to a suitable agent or part of the system (a 'getter'), with the result that their harmful effect is eliminated. Gettering originated in vaccuum tubes, where Ti was used to getter trace remnant gasses. Gettering is important today for the removal of unwanted trace elements (typically metals) from Silicon integrated circuits."

In fluid dynamics, laminar flow is a flow regime characterized by high momentum diffusion, low momentum convection, pressure and velocity independent from time. It is the opposite of turbulent flow. In nonscientific terms laminar flow is 'smooth,' while turbulent flow is 'rough.'"
Hold,Liquid,Leidenfrost Effect,"A phenomenon in which a liquid, in near contact with a mass significantly hotter than its boiling point, produces an insulating vapour layer which keeps that liquid from boiling rapidly. Due to this repulsive force, the droplet hovers over the surface rather than making physical contact with it. Commonly seen in the case of droplets of water skittering across a very hot metal surface."

Hold,Liquid,Magnetic Field,"A vector field which surrounds magnets and electric currents, and is detected by the force it exerts on moving electric charges and on magnetic materials. When placed in a magnetic field, magnetic dipoles tend to align their axes parallel to the magnetic field. Magnetic fields also have their own energy with an energy density proportional to the square of the field intensity."
Hold,Liquid,Magnetism,"One of the phenomena by which materials exert attractive or repulsive forces on other materials. Some well-known materials that exhibit easily detectable magnetic properties (called magnets) are nickel, iron, cobalt, and their alloys; however, all materials are influenced to greater or lesser degree by the presence of a magnetic field."

Hold,Liquid,Magnetorheological Fluid,"A suspension of micrometer-sized magnetic particles in a carrier fluid, usually a type of oil. When subjected to a magnetic field, the fluid greatly increases its apparent viscosity, to the point of becoming a viscoelastic solid. The yield stress of the fluid when in its active ('on') state can be controlled very accurately by varying the magnetic field intensity, hence the fluid's ability to transmit force can be controlled with an electromagnet, which gives rise to its many possible control-based applications."
Hold,Liquid,Marangoni Effect,(or Gibbs-Marangoni effect) The presence of a gradient in surface tension will naturally cause the liquid to flow away from regions of low surface tension. The surface tension gradient can be caused by concentration gradient or by a temperature gradient (surface tension is a function of temperature).
Hold,Liquid,Metal Foam,"A cellular structure consisting of a solid metal, frequently aluminium, containing a large volume fraction of gas-filled pores. The pores can be sealed (closed-cell foam), or they can form an interconnected network (open-cell foam)."
Hold,Liquid,Metal Organic Framework,"(or MOF). A class of cordination polymers consisting of metal ions or clusters coordinated to organic ligands to form 1, 2 or 3-dimensional structures with the special feature that they are often porous.

Other possible applications of MOFs are in gas purification, gas separation, catalysis, as sensors and as supercapacitors."
Hold,Liquid,Metastability,A general scientific concept which describes states of delicate equilibrium.

It is analogous to being at the bottom of a small valley when there is a deeper valley close by
Hold,Liquid,Microemulsion,"A clear, stable, isotropic liquid mixture of oil, water and surfactant, frequently in combination with a cosurfactant. In contrast to ordinary emulsions, microemulsions form upon simple mixing of the components and do not require the high shear conditions generally used in the formation of ordinary emulsions. The two basic types of microemulsions are direct (oil dispersed in water, o/w) and reversed (water dispersed in oil, w/o)."

Hold,Liquid,Mineral Hydration,"An inorganic chemical reaction where water is added to the crystal structure of a mineral, usually creating a new mineral, usually called a hydrate.There are two main ways in which minerals hydrate. One is conversion of an oxide to a double hydroxide, e.g. hydration of calcium oxide - CaO - to calcium hydroxide - Ca(OH)2, the other is incorporation of water molecules directly into the crystalline structure of the mineral, e.g. the hydration of feldspars to clay minerals. Hydration is the mechanism by which Portland cement develops strength."
Hold,Liquid,Molecular Sieve,A material containing tiny pores of a precise and uniform size that is used as an adsorbent for gases and liquids.

Hold,Liquid,Non-Newtonian Fluids,"Fluids whose flow properties are not described by a single constant value of viscosity. In a non-Newtonian fluid, the relation between the shear stress and the strain rate is nonlinear, and can even be time-dependent. Therefore a constant coefficient of viscosity can not be defined. A ratio between shear stress and rate of strain (or shear-dependent viscosity) can be defined, this being more useful for fluids without time-dependent behavior."
Hold,Liquid,Nucleation,"The extremely localised budding of a distinct thermodynamic phase. Some examples of phases that may form via nucleation in liquids are gaseous bubbles, crystals or glassy regions. Creation of liquid droplets in saturated vapor is also characterized by nucleation.

Hold,Liquid,Optical Tweezers,"A scientific instrument that uses a focused laser beam to provide an attractive or repulsive force (typically on the order of piconewtons), depending on the refractive index mismatch to physically hold and move microscopic dielectric objects. Optical tweezers have been particularly successful in studying a variety of biological systems."

The goal of this art is to create a representation of an object using geometric folds and crease patterns preferably without the use of gluing or cutting the paper, and using only one piece of paper. Origami only uses a small number of different folds, but they can be combined in a variety of ways to make intricate designs."
Hold,Liquid,Osmosis,"A physical process in which a solvent moves, without input of energy, across a semipermeable membrane (permeable to the solvent, but not the solute) separating two solutions of different concentrations.Osmosis releases energy, and can be made to do work."
Hold,Liquid,Ouzo Effect,"(also louche effect and spontaneous emulsification) is a phenomenon observed when water is added to ouzo and other anise-flavored liqueurs and spirits, such as pastis, raki, arak and absinthe, forming a milky (louche) oil-in-water microemulsion. Such microemulsions occur with only minimal mixing and are highly stable."
Hold,Liquid,Permeation,"The penetration of a permeate (such as a liquid, gas, or vapour) through a solid. The permeate always migrates to the lower concentration in three steps: 1.

Hold,Liquid,Porosity,The quality of being porous - i.e. having voids or spaces within a solid substance within or through which fluids can be present.
Hold,Liquid,Potential Well,"The region surrounding a local minimum of potential energy. Energy held in a potential well is unable to convert to another type of energy (kinetic energy in the case of a gravitational potential well) because it is captured in the local minimum of a potential well and so may not proceed to the global minimum of potential energy, as it would naturally tend to due to entropy."
Hold,Liquid,Reaction (physics),"In classical mechanics, Newton's third law states that forces occur in pairs: the Action and the Reaction. Both forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. The distinction between action and reaction is purely arbitrary: any one of the two forces can be considered an action, in which case the other (corresponding) force automatically becomes its associated reaction."
Hold,Liquid,Reticulated Foam,"A very porous, low density solid foam. Reticulated foams are extremely open foams i.e. there are few, if any, intact bubbles or cell windows. In contrast, the foam formed by soap bubbles is composed solely of intact (fully enclosed) bubbles. In a reticulated foam only the linear boundaries where the bubbles meet remain."
Hold,Liquid,Rheopecty,"(or rheopexy) The rare property of some non-Newtonian fluids to show a time-dependent change in viscosity; the longer the fluid undergoes shearing force, the higher its viscosity. Rheopectic fluids, such as some lubricants, thicken or solidify when shaken (the opposite type of behaviour, in which fluids become less viscous the longer they undergo shear, is called thixotropy and is much more common)."
Hold,Liquid,Semipermeable Membrane,"A membrane that will allow certain molecules or ions to pass through it by diffusion (and occasionally specialized facilitated diffusion). The rate of passage depends on the pressure, concentration, and temperature of the molecules or solutes on either side, as well as the permeability of the membrane to each solute."

Hold,Liquid,Suspension,"A heterogeneous fluid containing solid particles that are sufficiently large for sedimentation. Usually they must be larger than 1 micrometer. The internal phase (solid) is dispersed throughout the external phase (fluid - which may be liquid or gas) through mechanical agitation, with the use of certain excipients or suspending agents."
Hold,Liquid,Thixotropy,"The property of some non-Newtonian pseudoplastic fluids to show a time-dependent change in viscosity; the longer the fluid undergoes shear stress, the lower its viscosity.

Hold,Liquid,Ultrasonic Capillary Effect,"Abnormally high rise of a liquid and its penetration into capillary channels due to a high-intensity ultrasound field. Caused by the collapse of cavitation bubbles at the capillary inlet. A collaping bubble generates a liquid microjet, the penetration of which into capillary channel causes the height increment of the capillary liquid column. Summation of such increments lies behind the increase of a height and a velocity of the liquid rise in a capillary under the ultrasound action."
Hold,Liquid,Van der Waals Force,"The sum of the attractive or repulsive forces between molecules (or between parts of the same molecule) other than those due to covalent bonds or to the electrostatic interaction of ions with one another or with neutral molecules. Includes Keesom Force, Debye Force and London dispersion force."

Hold,Liquid,Vortex Generator,"An aerodynamic surface, consisting of a small vane that creates a vortex. Vortex generators can be found on many devices, but the term is most often used in aircraft design. Vortex generators are likely to be found on the external surfaces of vehicles where flow separation is a potential problem because vortex generators delay flow separation."
Hold,Liquid,Vortex Ring,"A torus shaped vortex in a fluid i.e. a region where the fluid mostly spins around an imaginary axis line that forms a closed loop. The dominant flow in a vortex ring is said to be toroidal, more precisely poloidal. Within a stationary body of fluid, a vortex ring can travel for relatively long distance, carrying the spinning fluid with it."
Hold,Liquid,Weightlessness,"(or zero-g) is any condition equivalent to experiencing little or no acceleration or gravitational attraction, e.g., far from a planet, star, or other massive body, flying an outside loop. From the equivalence principle for acceleration and gravitational attraction it follows that weightlessness can also be experienced in free fall, which is the cause of weightlessness of objects in orbit about the Earth."

Hold,Solid,Bingham Plastic,"A viscoplastic material that behaves as a rigid body at low stresses but flows as a viscous fluid at high stress. A common example is toothpaste, which will not be extruded until a certain pressure is applied to the tube. It then is pushed out as a solid plug."
Hold,Solid,Boundary Layer,A boundary layer is that layer of fluid in the immediate vicinity of a bounding surface. The boundary layer effect occurs at the field region in which all changes occur in the flow pattern. The boundary layer distorts surrounding nonviscous flow.
Hold,Solid,Brazing,"A joining process whereby a filler metal or alloy is melted by heat and distributed between two or more close-fitting parts by capillary action.

Hold,Solid,Chain,A chain is a series of connected links.
Hold,Solid,Chemical Bonding,"The physical process responsible for the attractive interactions between atoms and molecules, and which confers stability to diatomic and polyatomic chemical compounds.

Molecules, crystals, and diatomic gases and most of the physical environment around us are held together by chemical bonds."
Hold,Solid,Close Packing,"A dense arrangement of equal spheres in an infinite, regular arrangement (or lattice). There are two simple regular lattices that achieve highest average density: face-centered cubic (also called cubic close packed) and hexagonal close-packed. Both are based upon sheets of spheres arranged at the vertices of a triangular tiling; they differ in how the sheets are stacked upon one another."
Hold,Solid,Coffee Ring Effect,A pattern left by a puddle of particle-laden liquid after it evaporates. Named after the characteristic ring-like deposit along the perimeter of a spill of coffee. The pattern is due to capillary flow induced by the differential evaporation rates across the drop: liquid evaporating from the edge is replenished by liquid from the interior. The resulting edgeward flow can carry nearly all the dispersed material to the edge.
Hold,Solid,Cohesion,"The action or property of like molecules sticking together, being mutually attractive. This is an intrinsic property of a substance that is caused by the shape and structure of its molecules which makes the distribution of orbiting electrons irregular when molecules get close to one another, creating electrical attraction that can maintain a macroscopic structure such as a water drop."
Hold,Solid,Cold-forming,"A metalworking process in which metal is shaped at a temperature below its recrystallisation temperature, usually at the ambient temperature. Cold forming techniques are usually classified into four major groups: squeezing, bending, drawing, and shearing."
Hold,Solid,Colloid,"A type of chemical mixture where one substance is dispersed evenly throughout another. The particles of the dispersed substance are only suspended in the mixture, unlike a solution, where they are completely dissolved within. This occurs because the particles in a colloid are larger than in a solution - small enough to be dispersed evenly and maintain a homogenous appearance, but large enough to scatter light and not dissolve."
Hold,Solid,Crystallisation,"The (natural or artificial) process of formation of solid crystals precipitating from a identical solution or melt, or more rarely deposited directly from a gas. Crystallisation is also a chemical solid-liquid separation technique, in which mass transfer of a solute from the liquid solution to a pure solid crystalline phase occurs."

A typical characteristic property of an EAP is that it will undergo a large amount of deformation while sustaining large forces.
Hold,Solid,Electrodynamic Bearing,"A system providing contactless electrodynamic suspension of rotating shafts based on the induction of eddy currents in a rotating conductor. When an electrically conducting material is moving in a magnetic field, a current will be generated in the material that counters the change in the magnetic field (known as Lenz' Law). This generates a current that will result in a magnetic field that is oriented opposite to the one from the magnet. The electrically conducting material is thus acting as a magnetic mirror."
Hold,Solid,Electromagnet,"A type of magnet whose magnetic field is produced by the flow of electric current. The magnetic field disappears when the current ceases. Electromagnets are very widely used as components of other electrical devices, such as motors, generators, relays, loudspeakers, hard disks, MRI machines, scientific instruments, and magnetic separation equipment, as well as being employed as industrial lifting electromagnets for picking up and moving heavy iron objects like scrap iron."

Hold,Solid,Electrostatics,The phenomena arising from stationary or slowly moving electric charges
Hold,Solid,Electrostriction,"A property of all electrical non-conductors, or dielectrics, that causes them to change their shape under the application of an electric field.

The process does not melt either metal, instead it plasticises the surfaces of both metals, causing them to come into intimate contact sufficient to create a weld."
Hold,Solid,Faraday Wave,"(or Faraday Ripples) Nonlinear standing waves that appear on liquids enclosed by a vibrating receptacle. When the vibration frequency exceeds a critical value, the flat hydrostatic surface becomes unstable. The waves can take the form of stripes, close-packed hexagons, or even squares or quasiperiodic patterns."

Hold,Solid,Force,"That which can cause an object with mass to accelerate. Force has both magnitude & direction, i.e. it's a vector quantity. An object with constant mass will accelerate in proportion to the net force acting upon it and in inverse proportion to its mass (or the net force on an object is equal to the rate of change of momentum it experiences). Forces acting on objects may cause them to rotate or deform, or result in a change in pressure."
Hold,Solid,Freezing,"A phase change in which a liquid turns into a solid when its temperature is lowered below its freezing point. Colloquially it is applied to water, but technically it applies to any liquid. All known liquids, except liquid helium, freeze when the temperature is lowered enough."

Hold,Solid,Friction Welding,"A class of solid-state welding processes that generates heat through mechanical friction between a moving workpiece and a stationary component, with the addition of a lateral force called 'upset' to plastically displace and fuse the materials. Technically, because no melt occurs, friction welding is not actually a welding process in the traditional sense, but a forging technique."
Hold,Solid,Gecko-Foot Bristle Array,"The toes of the gecko adhere to a wide variety of surfaces, without the use of liquids or surface tension. The attractive forces that hold geckos to surfaces are van der Waals interactions between the finely divided spatula tipped setae (bristle array) and the surfaces themselves."
Hold,Solid,Gel,"A gel is a solid, jelly-like material that can have properties ranging from soft and weak to hard and tough. Gels are defined as a substantially dilute crosslinked system, which exhibits no flow when in the steady-state. By weight, gels are mostly liquid, yet they behave like solids due to a three-dimensional crosslinked network within the liquid. It is the crosslinks within the fluid that give a gel its structure (hardness) and contribute to stickiness (tack)."
Hold,Solid,Gettering,"A process for removal of impurities by reacting them with or attracting them to a suitable agent or part of the system (a 'getter'), with the result that their harmful effect is eliminated.

Hold,Solid,Magnetorheological Elastomer,"(or magnetosensitive elastomers) A class of solids that consist of polymeric matrix with embedded micro- or nano-sized ferromagnetic particles such as carbonyl iron. As a result of this composite microstructure, the mechanical properties of these materials can be controlled by the application of magnetic field."
Hold,Solid,Magnetorheological Fluid,"A suspension of micrometer-sized magnetic particles in a carrier fluid, usually a type of oil. When subjected to a magnetic field, the fluid greatly increases its apparent viscosity, to the point of becoming a viscoelastic solid. The yield stress of the fluid when in its active ('on') state can be controlled very accurately by varying the magnetic field intensity, hence the fluid's ability to transmit force can be controlled with an electromagnet, which gives rise to its many possible control-based applications."
Hold,Solid,Magnetostriction,A property of ferromagnetic materials that causes them to change their shape or dimensions during the process of magnetisation. The variation of material's magnetisation due to the applied magnetic field changes the magnetostrictive strain until reaching its saturation value.

Hold,Solid,Memory Foam,"(visco-elastic polyurethane foam). Made from polyurethane with additional chemicals that increase its viscosity level, thereby increasing its density. Depending on the chemicals used and its overall density, it is firmer in cool temperatures and softer when warm. Higher density memory foam reacts to body heat which allows it to mould itself to the shape of a warm body within a few minutes. A lower density memory foam is pressure-sensitive and will mould more quickly to the shape of the body."
Hold,Solid,Metastability,A general scientific concept which describes states of delicate equilibrium. A system is in a metastable state when it is in equilibrium (not changing with time) but is susceptible to fall into lower-energy states with only slight interaction.

In a piezomagnetic, one may induce a spontaneous magnetic moment by applying physical stress, or a physical deformation by applying a magnetic field. Piezomagnetism differs from the related property of magnetostriction."
Hold,Solid,Potential Well,"The region surrounding a local minimum of potential energy. Energy held in a potential well is unable to convert to another type of energy (kinetic energy in the case of a gravitational potential well) because it is captured in the local minimum of a potential well and so may not proceed to the global minimum of potential energy, as it would naturally tend to due to entropy."

Hold,Solid,Reaction (physics),"In classical mechanics, Newton's third law states that forces occur in pairs: the Action and the Reaction. Both forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. The distinction between action and reaction is purely arbitrary: any one of the two forces can be considered an action, in which case the other (corresponding) force automatically becomes its associated reaction."
Hold,Solid,Rheopecty,"(or rheopexy) The rare property of some non-Newtonian fluids to show a time-dependent change in viscosity; the longer the fluid undergoes shearing force, the higher its viscosity.

Adsorption is the physical adherence or bonding of ions and molecules onto the surface of another molecule."
Hold,Solid,Spark Plasma Sintering,"(or Field Assisted Sintering Technique (FAST) or Pulsed Electric Current Sintering (PECS)). The main characteristic of the Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) is that the pulsed DC current directly passes through the graphite die, as well as the powder compact, in case of conductive samples. Therefore, the heat is generated internally which facilitates a very high heating or cooling rate (up to 1000k/min), hence the sintering process generally is very fast (within a few minutes)."

The polarity and strength of the charges produced differ according to the materials, surface roughness, temperature, strain, and other properties."
Hold,Solid,Vacuum,"A volume of space that is essentially empty of matter, such that its gaseous pressure is much less than atmospheric pressure. A perfect vacuum would be one with no particles in it at all, which is impossible to achieve in practice. Physicists often discuss ideal test results that would occur in a perfect vacuum, which they simply call 'vacuum' or 'free space', and use the term partial vacuum to refer to real vacuum."
Hold,Solid,Van der Waals Force,"The sum of the attractive or repulsive forces between molecules (or between parts of the same molecule) other than those due to covalent bonds or to the electrostatic interaction of ions with one another or with neutral molecules. Includes Keesom Force, Debye Force and London dispersion force."
Hold,Solid,Velcro,"A brand name of fabric hook-and-loop fasteners. It consists of two layers: a 'hook' side, which is a piece of fabric covered with tiny hooks, and a 'loop' side, which is covered with even smaller and 'hairier' loops. When the two sides are pressed together, the hooks catch in the loops and hold the pieces together. When the layers are separated, the strips make a characteristic 'ripping' sound."
Hold,Solid,Vitrification,"The transformation of a substance into a glass. Usually, it is achieved by rapdily cooling a liquid through the glass transition. Certain chemical reactions also result in glasses."

An object with constant mass will accelerate in proportion to the net force acting upon it and in inverse proportion to its mass (or the net force on an object is equal to the rate of change of momentum it experiences). Forces acting on objects may cause them to rotate or deform, or result in a change in pressure."

Compressors are similar to pumps: both increase the pressure on a fluid and both can transport the fluid through a pipe. As gases are compressible, the compressor also reduces the volume of a gas. Liquids are relatively incompressible, so the main action of a pump is to transport liquids."
Join,Divided Solid,Gel,"A gel is a solid, jelly-like material that can have properties ranging from soft and weak to hard and tough. Gels are defined as a substantially dilute crosslinked system, which exhibits no flow when in the steady-state.

Occurs because larger particles are more energetically favored than smaller particles. This stems from the fact that molecules on the surface of a particle are energetically less stable than the ones in the interior. Ostwald ripening is also observed in liquid-liquid systems, causing diffusion of monomers (i.e. individual molecules or atoms) from smaller droplets to larger droplets due to greater solubility of the single monomer molecules in the larger monomer droplets."

Join,Liquid,Ostwald Ripening,"An observed phenomenon in solid solutions or liquid sols that describes the change of an inhomogeneous structure over time, i.e., small crystals or sol particles dissolve, and redeposit onto larger crystals or sol particles. Occurs because larger particles are more energetically favored than smaller particles. This stems from the fact that molecules on the surface of a particle are energetically less stable than the ones in the interior. Ostwald ripening is also observed in liquid-liquid systems, causing diffusion of monomers (i.e. individual molecules or atoms) from smaller droplets to larger droplets due to greater solubility of the single monomer molecules in the larger monomer droplets."

The resulting edgeward flow can carry nearly all the dispersed material to the edge.
Move,Divided Solid,Colloid,"A type of chemical mixture where one substance is dispersed evenly throughout another. The particles of the dispersed substance are only suspended in the mixture, unlike a solution, where they are completely dissolved within.

Move,Divided Solid,Ostwald Ripening,"An observed phenomenon in solid solutions or liquid sols that describes the change of an inhomogeneous structure over time, i.e., small crystals or sol particles dissolve, and redeposit onto larger crystals or sol particles. Occurs because larger particles are more energetically favored than smaller particles. This stems from the fact that molecules on the surface of a particle are energetically less stable than the ones in the interior. Ostwald ripening is also observed in liquid-liquid systems, causing diffusion of monomers (i.e. individual molecules or atoms) from smaller droplets to larger droplets due to greater solubility of the single monomer molecules in the larger monomer droplets."

Move,Field,Colloid,"A type of chemical mixture where one substance is dispersed evenly throughout another. The particles of the dispersed substance are only suspended in the mixture, unlike a solution, where they are completely dissolved within.

Convective heat and mass transfer take place through both diffusion (random Brownian motion) and by advection (transport by the larger-scale motion of currents). Note that a common use of the term convection refers specifically to heat transfer by convection, as opposed to convection in general."
Move,Field,Coriolis Force,"An apparent deflection, or force, experienced by moving objects when viewed from a rotating frame of reference. The Coriolis force is an example of a fictitious force (or pseudo force), because it does not appear when the motion is expressed in an inertial frame of reference. For example, freely moving objects on the surface of the Earth experience a Coriolis force, and appear to veer to the right in the northern hemisphere, and to the left in the southern."

Move,Field,Ferromagnetism,"The mechanism by which certain materials (such as iron) form permanent magnets and/or exhibit strong interactions with magnets. Responsible for commonly observed magnetism phenomena, e.g. 'fridge magnets. A material is 'ferromagnetic' only if all its magnetic ions add a positive contribution to the net magnetisation. If some of them subtract from the net magnetisation (i.e. are partially anti-aligned), then the material is 'ferrimagnetic'."

It is the crosslinks within the fluid that give a gel its structure (hardness) and contribute to stickiness (tack)."
Move,Field,Gravitational Lensing,"A gravitational lens is formed when the light from a very distant, bright source (such as a quasar) is 'bent' around a massive object (such as a cluster of galaxies) between the source object and the observer.

Move,Field,Ion Wind,"A stream of ionized fluid generated by a strong electric field (typically a sharp conductive point) exceeding the corona discharge inception voltage gradient, ionizing the air about the tip, creating a small jet of plasma. Ionised air molecules have the same polarity as the charged tip, so are replused as a like-charged ion cloud, that expands due to the repulsion between ions, creating an electric 'wind' and a hissing noise due to pressure change."
Move,Field,Kerr Effect,"(or the quadratic electro-optic effect) A change in the refractive index of a material in response to an electric field.

Move,Field,Negative Refraction,"An electromagnetic phenomenon where light rays are refracted at an interface in the reverse sense to that normally expected. Negative refraction occurs at interfaces between materials at which one has an ordinary positive phase velocity (i.e. a positive refractive index), and the other has the more exotic negative phase velocity (refractive index)."

Move,Field,Total Internal Reflection,"An optical phenomenon that occurs when a ray of light strikes a medium boundary at an angle larger than a particular critical angle with respect to the normal to the surface.

Move,Gas,Aerofoil,"The shape of a wing or blade (of a propeller, rotor or turbine) or sail as seen in cross-section. An aerofoil-shaped body moved through a fluid produces a force perpendicular to the motion called lift."
Move,Gas,Angular Momentum Conservation,In a closed system angular momentum is constant. The conservation of angular momentum explains the angular acceleration of an ice skater as she brings her arms and legs close to the vertical axis of rotation. By bringing part of mass of her body closer to the axis she decreases her body's moment of inertia. Because angular momentum is constant the angular velocity (rotational speed) of the skater has to increase.
Move,Gas,Archimedes' Principle (Buoyancy),"The upward force on an object produced by the surrounding liquid or gas in which it is fully or partially immersed, due to the pressure difference of the fluid between the top and bottom of the object. The net upward buoyancy force is equal to the magnitude of the weight of fluid displaced by the body. This force enables the object to float or at least to seem lighter."

Move,Gas,Capillary Condensation,"The process by which multilayer adsorption from the vapour phase into a porous medium proceeds to the point at which pore spaces become filled with condensed liquid from the vapour phase. The unique aspect of capillary condensation is that vapor condensation occurs below the saturation vapor pressure of the pure liquid. Can affect contact between solids, modifying macroscopic adhesion & friction properties."
Move,Gas,Centrifugal Force,"An outward force associated with rotation. Centrifugal force is one of several so-called pseudo-forces (or inertial forces), so named because, unlike real forces, they do not originate in interactions with other bodies situated in the environment of the particle upon which they act. Instead, centrifugal force originates in the rotation of the frame of reference within which observations are made."
Move,Gas,Chromatography,"A family of laboratory techniques for the separation of mixtures.

Note that a common use of the term convection refers specifically to heat transfer by convection, as opposed to convection in general."
Move,Gas,Converse Piezoelectric Effect,"Materials exhibiting the direct piezoelectric effect (the production of electricity when stress is applied) also exhibit the converse piezoelectric effect (the production of stress and/or strain when an electric field is applied). For example, lead zirconate titanate crystals will exhibit a maximum shape change of about 0.1% of the original dimension."
Move,Gas,Coriolis Force,"An apparent deflection, or force, experienced by moving objects when viewed from a rotating frame of reference. The Coriolis force is an example of a fictitious force (or pseudo force), because it does not appear when the motion is expressed in an inertial frame of reference. For example, freely moving objects on the surface of the Earth experience a Coriolis force, and appear to veer to the right in the northern hemisphere, and to the left in the southern."

An object with constant mass will accelerate in proportion to the net force acting upon it and in inverse proportion to its mass (or the net force on an object is equal to the rate of change of momentum it experiences). Forces acting on objects may cause them to rotate or deform, or result in a change in pressure."

Heat is transferred from the source, through the 'working body' of the engine, to the sink, and in this process some of the heat is converted into work by exploiting the properties of a working substance (usually a gas or liquid)."
Move,Gas,Heat Pipe,"A heat pipe is a heat transfer mechanism that can transport heat with a very small difference in temperature between the hotter and colder interfaces. Inside a heat pipe, at the hot interface a fluid turns to vapour and the gas naturally flows and condenses on the cold interface. The liquid falls or is moved by capillary action back to the hot interface to evaporate again and repeat the cycle."
Move,Gas,Impeller,A rotating component used to increase the pressure and flow of a fluid. Typically the rotating component of a centrifugal pump.

Move,Liquid,Angular Momentum,Angular momentum is the rotational counterpart of momentum. A spinning flywheel has angular momentum.
Move,Liquid,Angular Momentum Conservation,In a closed system angular momentum is constant. The conservation of angular momentum explains the angular acceleration of an ice skater as she brings her arms and legs close to the vertical axis of rotation. By bringing part of mass of her body closer to the axis she decreases her body's moment of inertia. Because angular momentum is constant the angular velocity (rotational speed) of the skater has to increase.
Move,Liquid,Antibubble,"A droplet of liquid surrounded by a thin film of gas, as opposed to a gas bubble, which is a sphere of gas surrounded by a thin film of liquid. Antibubbles are formed when liquid drops or flows turbulently into the same or another liquid. They can either skim across the surface of a liquid such as water (e.g. water globules), or be completely submerged in the liquid to which they are directed."

This pressure difference is proportional to the surface tension and inversely proportional to the effective radius of the interface. It also depends on the wetting angle of the liquid on the surface of the capillary.

Capillary waves are common in nature and home, and are often referred to as ripple. The wavelength of capillary waves is typically less than a few centimeters. A gravity-capillary wave on a fluid interface is influenced by both the effects of surface tension and gravity, as well as by the fluid inertia."
Move,Liquid,Cavitation,"The formation of vapour bubbles in a flowing liquid in a region where the pressure of the liquid falls below its vapour pressure. Usually divided into two classes of behavior. Inertial (or transient) cavitation occurs when a void or bubble in a liquid rapidly collapses, producing a shock wave. Non-inertial cavitation is the process in which a bubble in a fluid is forced to oscillate in size or shape due to energy input, e.g. acoustic field."
Move,Liquid,Centrifugal Force,"An outward force associated with rotation. Centrifugal force is one of several so-called pseudo-forces (or inertial forces), so named because, unlike real forces, they do not originate in interactions with other bodies situated in the environment of the particle upon which they act. Instead, centrifugal force originates in the rotation of the frame of reference within which observations are made."
Move,Liquid,Chromatography,"A family of laboratory techniques for the separation of mixtures. It involves passing a mixture dissolved in a 'mobile phase' through a stationary phase, which separates the analyte to be measured from other molecules in the mixture and allows it to be isolated.

Move,Liquid,Coffee Ring Effect,A pattern left by a puddle of particle-laden liquid after it evaporates. Named after the characteristic ring-like deposit along the perimeter of a spill of coffee. The pattern is due to capillary flow induced by the differential evaporation rates across the drop: liquid evaporating from the edge is replenished by liquid from the interior. The resulting edgeward flow can carry nearly all the dispersed material to the edge.
Move,Liquid,Colloid,"A type of chemical mixture where one substance is dispersed evenly throughout another. The particles of the dispersed substance are only suspended in the mixture, unlike a solution, where they are completely dissolved within. This occurs because the particles in a colloid are larger than in a solution - small enough to be dispersed evenly and maintain a homogenous appearance, but large enough to scatter light and not dissolve."
Move,Liquid,Compression,"The result of the subjection of a material to compressive stress, resulting in reduction of volume. The opposite of compression is tension. In simple terms, compression is a pushing force."

Move,Liquid,Convection,"The movement of molecules within fluids (i.e. liquids, gases) and rheids. One of the major modes of heat transfer and mass transfer. Convective heat and mass transfer take place through both diffusion (random Brownian motion) and by advection (transport by the larger-scale motion of currents). Note that a common use of the term convection refers specifically to heat transfer by convection, as opposed to convection in general."
Move,Liquid,Converse Piezoelectric Effect,"Materials exhibiting the direct piezoelectric effect (the production of electricity when stress is applied) also exhibit the converse piezoelectric effect (the production of stress and/or strain when an electric field is applied). For example, lead zirconate titanate crystals will exhibit a maximum shape change of about 0.1% of the original dimension."
Move,Liquid,Coriolis Force,"An apparent deflection, or force, experienced by moving objects when viewed from a rotating frame of reference. The Coriolis force is an example of a fictitious force (or pseudo force), because it does not appear when the motion is expressed in an inertial frame of reference. For example, freely moving objects on the surface of the Earth experience a Coriolis force, and appear to veer to the right in the northern hemisphere, and to the left in the southern."
Move,Liquid,Couette Flow,"The laminar flow of a viscous fluid in the space between two parallel plates, one of which is moving relative to the other. The flow is driven by virtue of viscous drag force acting on the fluid and the applied pressure gradient parallel to the plates."
Move,Liquid,Creaming,"The migration of the dispersed phase of an emulsion, under the influence of buoyancy. The particles float upwards or sink, depending on how large they are and how much less dense or more dense they may be than the continuous phase, and also how viscous or how thixotropic the continuous phase might be. For as long as the particles remain separated, the process is called creaming."

The ferromagnetic nano-particles are coated with a surfactant to prevent their agglomeration (due to van der Waals and magnetic forces)."
Move,Liquid,Ferromagnetism,"The mechanism by which certain materials (such as iron) form permanent magnets and/or exhibit strong interactions with magnets. Responsible for commonly observed magnetism phenomena, e.g. 'fridge magnets. A material is 'ferromagnetic' only if all its magnetic ions add a positive contribution to the net magnetisation. If some of them subtract from the net magnetisation (i.e. are partially anti-aligned), then the material is 'ferrimagnetic'."

Move,Liquid,Flow Separation,"For a solid object travelling through a fluid (or alternatively a stationary object exposed to a moving fluid) flow separation occurs when the boundary layer travels far enough against an adverse pressure gradient that the speed of the boundary layer falls almost to zero.The fluid flow becomes detached from the surface of the object, and instead takes the forms of eddies and vortices."
Move,Liquid,Fluid Hammer,"A pressure surge or wave resulting when a fluid in motion is forced to stop or change direction suddenly (Momentum Change). Water hammer commonly occurs when a valve is closed suddenly at an end of a pipeline system, and a pressure wave propagates in the pipe."

Move,Liquid,Force,"That which can cause an object with mass to accelerate. Force has both magnitude & direction, i.e. it's a vector quantity. An object with constant mass will accelerate in proportion to the net force acting upon it and in inverse proportion to its mass (or the net force on an object is equal to the rate of change of momentum it experiences). Forces acting on objects may cause them to rotate or deform, or result in a change in pressure."

Gels are defined as a substantially dilute crosslinked system, which exhibits no flow when in the steady-state. By weight, gels are mostly liquid, yet they behave like solids due to a three-dimensional crosslinked network within the liquid. It is the crosslinks within the fluid that give a gel its structure (hardness) and contribute to stickiness (tack)."

In an open channel flow, this manifests as the fast flow rapidly slowing and piling up on top of itself."

While pouring one the liquid onto a surface, the surface suddenly spouts an upcoming jet of liquid which merges with the downgoing one. Common household liquids with this property are liquid hand soaps, shampoos and non-drip paint. The effect usually goes unnoticed, however, because it seldom lasts more than about 300ms."
Move,Liquid,Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability,"A fluid interface that can occur when there is velocity shear in a single continuous fluid, or where there is a velocity difference across the interface between two fluids. An example is wind blowing over water: The instability manifests in waves on the water surface. More generally, clouds, the ocean, Saturn's bands, and the sun's corona show this instability."
Move,Liquid,Leidenfrost Effect,"A phenomenon in which a liquid, in near contact with a mass significantly hotter than its boiling point, produces an insulating vapour layer which keeps that liquid from boiling rapidly.

Move,Liquid,Magnetostriction,A property of ferromagnetic materials that causes them to change their shape or dimensions during the process of magnetisation. The variation of material's magnetisation due to the applied magnetic field changes the magnetostrictive strain until reaching its saturation value. This effect can cause losses due to frictional heating in susceptible ferromagnetic cores.

Materials which undergo this unusual process have a range of potential engineering, photonic, electronic, and structural applications. For example, mixing a negative thermal expansion material with a 'normal' material which expands on heating, could result in a zero expansion composite material."
Move,Liquid,Nuclear Fission,"The splitting of the nucleus of an atom into parts (lighter nuclei) often producing free neutrons and other smaller nuclei, which may eventually produce photons (in the form of gamma rays).

Move,Liquid,Ostwald Ripening,"An observed phenomenon in solid solutions or liquid sols that describes the change of an inhomogeneous structure over time, i.e., small crystals or sol particles dissolve, and redeposit onto larger crystals or sol particles. Occurs because larger particles are more energetically favored than smaller particles. This stems from the fact that molecules on the surface of a particle are energetically less stable than the ones in the interior. Ostwald ripening is also observed in liquid-liquid systems, causing diffusion of monomers (i.e. individual molecules or atoms) from smaller droplets to larger droplets due to greater solubility of the single monomer molecules in the larger monomer droplets."

Move,Liquid,Pervaporation,"A method for the separation of mixtures of liquids by partial vaporisation through a non-porous or porous membrane. The name is derived from the two basic steps of the process, firstly the permeation through the membrane by the permeate, then its evaporation into the vapor phase. This process is used by a number of industries for several different processes, including purification and analysis, due to its simplicity and in-line nature."
Move,Liquid,Photophoresis,The phenomenon that small particles suspended in gas (aerosols) or liquids (hydrocolloids) starts to migrate when illuminated by a sufficiently intense beam of light.

Both forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. The distinction between action and reaction is purely arbitrary: any one of the two forces can be considered an action, in which case the other (corresponding) force automatically becomes its associated reaction."
Move,Liquid,Resonance,"The tendency of a system to oscillate with larger amplitude at some frequencies than at others. These are known as the system's resonant frequencies. At these frequencies, even small periodic driving forces can produce large amplitude oscillations, because the system stores vibrational energy."

Move,Liquid,Syphon,"Typically an inverted U shaped tube, which allows a liquid to flow uphill without a pump, over an obstacle and then discharge at a level lower than the surface of the original reservoir. Practical siphons operate because gravity causes the hydrostatic pressure at the downstream end of the tube to be significantly higher than the surrounding pressure so fluid flows out of the tube into the atmosphere or into a second reservoir lower than the first."
Move,Liquid,Temperature Gradient,The variation in temperature over distance.
Move,Liquid,Tesla Turbine,"(or boundary layer turbine, cohesion-type turbine or Prandtl layer turbine) A bladeless centrifugal flow turbine expander that uses the boundary layer effect and not a fluid impinging upon the blades as in a conventional turbine. Consists of a set of smooth disks, with nozzles applying a moving gas to the edge of the disk. The gases drag on the disk by viscosity and adhesion of the surface layer of the gas. As the gas slows and adds energy to the disks, it spirals in to the center exhaust. Since the rotor has no projections, it is very sturdy."

Move,Liquid,Thermomechanical Effect,"One of the most spectacular results of the properties of superfluids is known as the thermomechanical or 'fountain effect'. If a capillary tube is placed into a bath of superfluid helium and then heated, even by shining a light on it, the superfluid helium will flow up through the tube and out the top."

Move,Liquid,Transpiration,"The loss of water vapour from parts of plants (similar to sweating), especially in leaves but also in stems, flowers and roots. Leaf surfaces are dotted with openings called, collectively, stomata. Leaf transpiration occurs through stomata, and can be thought of as a necessary 'cost' associated with the opening of the stomata to allow the diffusion of carbon dioxide gas from the air for photosynthesis. Transpiration also cools plants and enables mass flow of mineral nutrients and water from roots to shoots."
Move,Liquid,Turbine,"A rotary engine that extracts energy from a fluid flow. The simplest turbines have one moving part, a rotor assembly, which is a shaft with blades attached.

Move,Liquid,Ultrasonic Vibration,Vibration at ultrasonic frequencies.
Move,Liquid,Vacuum,"A volume of space that is essentially empty of matter, such that its gaseous pressure is much less than atmospheric pressure. A perfect vacuum would be one with no particles in it at all, which is impossible to achieve in practice. Physicists often discuss ideal test results that would occur in a perfect vacuum, which they simply call 'vacuum' or 'free space', and use the term partial vacuum to refer to real vacuum."

Move,Liquid,Venturi Effect,"The reduction in fluid pressure that results when a fluid flows through a constricted section of pipe. The fluid velocity must increase through the constriction to satisfy the equation of continuity, while its pressure must decrease due to conservation of energy: the gain in kinetic energy is balanced by a drop in pressure or a pressure gradient force."

Move,Liquid,Wetting,"The ability of a liquid to maintain contact with a solid surface, resulting from intermolecular interactions when the two are brought together. The degree of wetting is determined by a force balance between adhesive and cohesive forces. Adhesive forces between a liquid and solid cause a liquid drop to spread across the surface. Cohesive forces within the liquid cause the drop to ball up and avoid contact with the surface."
Move,Liquid,Wind,The flow of air or other gases that compose an atmosphere

The internal angle between the surface of the pile and the horizontal surface is known as the angle of repose and is related to the density, surface area and shapes of the particles, and the coefficient of friction of the material."
Move,Solid,Angular Momentum,Angular momentum is the rotational counterpart of momentum. A spinning flywheel has angular momentum.
Move,Solid,Angular Momentum Conservation,In a closed system angular momentum is constant. The conservation of angular momentum explains the angular acceleration of an ice skater as she brings her arms and legs close to the vertical axis of rotation. By bringing part of mass of her body closer to the axis she decreases her body's moment of inertia. Because angular momentum is constant the angular velocity (rotational speed) of the skater has to increase.

Move,Solid,Centrifugal Force,"An outward force associated with rotation. Centrifugal force is one of several so-called pseudo-forces (or inertial forces), so named because, unlike real forces, they do not originate in interactions with other bodies situated in the environment of the particle upon which they act. Instead, centrifugal force originates in the rotation of the frame of reference within which observations are made."
Move,Solid,Cheerio Effect,The tendency for small wettable floating objects to attract one another as a result of a combination of surface tension and buoyancy.
Move,Solid,Chemical Transport Reactions,"A process for purification and crystallisation of non-volatile solids. Entails the reversible conversion of nonvolatile elements and chemical compounds into volatile derivatives.

Elsewhere in the tube where the temperature is held at a different temperature, the volatile derivative reverts to the parent solid and the transport agent is released."
Move,Solid,Coanda Effect,The tendency of a fluid jet to stay attached to an adjacent suitably shaped curved surface. Also applies to powdered solids.
Move,Solid,Coffee Ring Effect,A pattern left by a puddle of particle-laden liquid after it evaporates. Named after the characteristic ring-like deposit along the perimeter of a spill of coffee.

The resulting edgeward flow can carry nearly all the dispersed material to the edge.
Move,Solid,Coilgun,A type of synchronous linear electric motor that consists of one or more electromagnetic coils used to accelerate a magnetic projectile to high velocity.
Move,Solid,Colloid,"A type of chemical mixture where one substance is dispersed evenly throughout another. The particles of the dispersed substance are only suspended in the mixture, unlike a solution, where they are completely dissolved within. This occurs because the particles in a colloid are larger than in a solution - small enough to be dispersed evenly and maintain a homogenous appearance, but large enough to scatter light and not dissolve."
Move,Solid,Compression,"The result of the subjection of a material to compressive stress, resulting in reduction of volume. The opposite of compression is tension. In simple terms, compression is a pushing force."

Move,Solid,Convection,"The movement of molecules within fluids (i.e. liquids, gases) and rheids. One of the major modes of heat transfer and mass transfer. Convective heat and mass transfer take place through both diffusion (random Brownian motion) and by advection (transport by the larger-scale motion of currents). Note that a common use of the term convection refers specifically to heat transfer by convection, as opposed to convection in general."
Move,Solid,Converse Piezoelectric Effect,"Materials exhibiting the direct piezoelectric effect (the production of electricity when stress is applied) also exhibit the converse piezoelectric effect (the production of stress and/or strain when an electric field is applied). For example, lead zirconate titanate crystals will exhibit a maximum shape change of about 0.1% of the original dimension."
Move,Solid,Coprecipitation,The carrying down by a precipitate of substances normally soluble under the conditions employed.
Move,Solid,Coriolis Force,"An apparent deflection, or force, experienced by moving objects when viewed from a rotating frame of reference. The Coriolis force is an example of a fictitious force (or pseudo force), because it does not appear when the motion is expressed in an inertial frame of reference. For example, freely moving objects on the surface of the Earth experience a Coriolis force, and appear to veer to the right in the northern hemisphere, and to the left in the southern."

Move,Solid,Creaming,"The migration of the dispersed phase of an emulsion, under the influence of buoyancy. The particles float upwards or sink, depending on how large they are and how much less dense or more dense they may be than the continuous phase, and also how viscous or how thixotropic the continuous phase might be. For as long as the particles remain separated, the process is called creaming."
Move,Solid,Creep,"The tendency of a solid material to slowly move or deform permanently under the influence of stresses. A result of long term exposure to levels of stress that are below the yield strength of the material.

Remove,Liquid,Explosion,"A sudden increase in volume and release of energy in an extreme manner, usually with the generation of high temperatures and the release of gases."
Remove,Liquid,Fermentation,"In an industrial context, fermentation refers to the breakdown of organic substances and re-assembly into other substances.

Occurs because larger particles are more energetically favored than smaller particles. This stems from the fact that molecules on the surface of a particle are energetically less stable than the ones in the interior. Ostwald ripening is also observed in liquid-liquid systems, causing diffusion of monomers (i.e. individual molecules or atoms) from smaller droplets to larger droplets due to greater solubility of the single monomer molecules in the larger monomer droplets."

Separate,Liquid,Pervaporation,"A method for the separation of mixtures of liquids by partial vaporisation through a non-porous or porous membrane. The name is derived from the two basic steps of the process, firstly the permeation through the membrane by the permeate, then its evaporation into the vapor phase.

Separate,Liquid,Photophoresis,The phenomenon that small particles suspended in gas (aerosols) or liquids (hydrocolloids) starts to migrate when illuminated by a sufficiently intense beam of light. The existence of this phenomenon is owed to a non-uniform distribution of temperature of an illuminated particle in a fluid medium.
Separate,Liquid,Plasma,"A partially ionized gas, in which a certain proportion of electrons are free rather than being bound to an atom or molecule. The ability of the positive and negative charges to move somewhat independently makes the plasma electrically conductive so that it responds strongly to electromagnetic fields. Plasma therefore has properties quite unlike those of solids, liquids or gases and is considered to be a distinct state of matter."

Separate,Liquid,Semipermeable Membrane,"A membrane that will allow certain molecules or ions to pass through it by diffusion (and occasionally specialized facilitated diffusion). The rate of passage depends on the pressure, concentration, and temperature of the molecules or solutes on either side, as well as the permeability of the membrane to each solute."

Separate,Solid,Centrifugal Force,"An outward force associated with rotation. Centrifugal force is one of several so-called pseudo-forces (or inertial forces), so named because, unlike real forces, they do not originate in interactions with other bodies situated in the environment of the particle upon which they act. Instead, centrifugal force originates in the rotation of the frame of reference within which observations are made."

Elsewhere in the tube where the temperature is held at a different temperature, the volatile derivative reverts to the parent solid and the transport agent is released."
Separate,Solid,Coffee Ring Effect,A pattern left by a puddle of particle-laden liquid after it evaporates. Named after the characteristic ring-like deposit along the perimeter of a spill of coffee. The pattern is due to capillary flow induced by the differential evaporation rates across the drop: liquid evaporating from the edge is replenished by liquid from the interior. The resulting edgeward flow can carry nearly all the dispersed material to the edge.

Torque-induced precession (gyroscopic precession) is the phenomenon in which the axis of a spinning object (e.g. a part of a gyroscope) 'wobbles' when a torque is applied to it.
Vibrate,Solid,Pulse Jet,"A type of jet engine in which combustion occurs in pulses. Pulse jet engines can be made with few or no moving parts and are capable of running statically (i.e. there is no need to have air forced into the inlet, such as by forward motion)."
Vibrate,Solid,Reaction Wheel,A type of flywheel used primarily by spacecraft to change their angular momentum without rockets or other reaction devices. Cab provide very precise changes in angle and hence spacecraft's attitude. Also applicable to non-spacecraft systems.
Vibrate,Solid,Resonance,"The tendency of a system to oscillate with larger amplitude at some frequencies than at others. These are known as the system's resonant frequencies. At these frequencies, even small periodic driving forces can produce large amplitude oscillations, because the system stores vibrational energy."
Vibrate,Solid,Reuleaux Triangle,A constant width curve based on an equilateral triangle. All points on a side are equidistant from the opposite vertex.
Vibrate,Solid,Screw,A helical inclined plane. A screw can convert a rotational force (torque) to a linear force and vice versa.
Vibrate,Solid,Shock Wave,"A type of propagating disturbance. Like an ordinary wave, it carries energy and can propagate through a medium (solid, liquid, gas or plasma) or through a field such as the electromagnetic field. Characterized by an abrupt, nearly discontinuous change in the characteristics of the medium. Associated with rapid rise in pressure, temperature and density of the flow. A shock wave travels through most media at a higher speed than an ordinary wave."
Vibrate,Solid,Solenoid,"A coil wound into a tightly packed helix. In physics, the term solenoid refers to a long, thin loop of wire, often wrapped around a metallic core, which produces a magnetic field when an electric current is passed through it. Solenoids are important because they can create controlled magnetic fields and can be used as electromagnets."
Vibrate,Solid,Sonochemistry,"The effect of sonic waves and wave properties on chemical systems. Sonochemistry arises from acoustic cavitation: the formation, growth, and implosive collapse of bubbles in a liquid. This is demonstrated in phenomena such as ultrasound, sonication, sonoluminescence, and sonic cavitation."
Vibrate,Solid,Sound,"A mechanical wave that is an oscillation of pressure transmitted through a solid, liquid, or gas, composed of frequencies within the range of hearing and of a level sufficiently strong to be heard."
Vibrate,Solid,Sphericon,"A three-dimensional solid with one side and two edges. May be constructed from a bicone (a double cone) with an apex of 90 degrees, by splitting the bicone along a plane through both apexes, rotating one of the two halves by 90 degrees, and reattaching the two halves. When rolled on a flat surface, every point on the surface of a sphericon comes in contact with the surface it is rolling on."
Vibrate,Solid,Spring,An elastic object used to store mechanical energy.
Vibrate,Solid,Stewart Platform,"A type of parallel robot that incorporates six prismatic actuators, commonly hydraulic jacks. These actuators are mounted in pairs to the mechanism's base, crossing over to three mounting points on a top plate. Devices placed on the top plate can be moved in the six degrees of freedom in which it is possible for a freely-suspended body to move."
Vibrate,Solid,Stick-slip Phenomenon,The spontaneous jerking motion that can occur while two objects are sliding over each other.
Vibrate,Solid,Surface Acoustic Wave,"(SAW) An acoustic wave traveling along the surface of a material having some elasticity, with an amplitude that typically decays exponentially with the depth of the substrate. This kind of wave is commonly used in devices called SAW devices in electronics circuits."
Vibrate,Solid,Swashplate,"A device used in mechanical engineering to translate the motion of a rotating shaft into reciprocating motion, or to translate a reciprocating motion into a rotating one to replace the crankshaft in engine designs."
Vibrate,Solid,Thermoacoustic Engine,"Thermoacoustic devices which use high-amplitude sound waves to pump heat from one place to another, or use a heat difference to induce high-amplitude sound waves. Can be divided into standing wave and travelling wave devices. These two types can again be divided in two thermodynamic classes, a prime mover (or simply heat engine), and a heat pump. The prime mover creates work using heat and a heat pump creates or moves heat using work."
Vibrate,Solid,Torsion Spring,"A flexible elastic object that stores mechanical energy when it is twisted. The amount of force (actually torque) it exerts is proportional to the amount it is twisted. A torsion spring is often made from a wire, ribbon, or bar of metal or rubber, while more delicate ones are made of silk, glass, or quartz fibers."
Vibrate,Solid,Tuned Mass Damper,"A device to stabilise against violent motion caused by harmonic vibration. A tuned damper reduces the vibration of a system with a comparatively lightweight component so that the worst-case vibrations are less intense. Roughly speaking practical systems are tuned to either move the main mode away from a troubling excitation frequency, or to add damping to a resonance that is difficult or expensive to damp directly. ."
Vibrate,Solid,Turbulence,"A fluid regime characterised by chaotic, stochastic property changes. This includes low momentum diffusion, high momentum convection, and rapid variation of pressure and velocity in space and time (flow that is not turbulent is called laminar flow)."
Vibrate,Solid,Ultrasonic Motor,"A type of electric motor powered by the ultrasonic vibration of a component, the stator, placed against another component, the rotor or slider depending on the scheme of operation (rotation or linear translation)."
Vibrate,Solid,Ultrasonic Vibration,Vibration at ultrasonic frequencies.
Vibrate,Solid,Vibrating String,"A vibrating string produces a sound whose frequency in most cases is constant. Therefore, since frequency characterizes the pitch, the sound produced is a constant note. Vibrating strings are the basis of any string instrument like guitar, cello, or piano."
Vibrate,Solid,Vibration,Mechanical oscillations about an equilibrium point. The oscillations may be periodic such as the motion of a pendulum or random such as the movement of a tire on a gravel road.
Vibrate,Solid,Viscoelasticity,The property of exhibiting both viscous and elastic characteristics when undergoing deformation.
Vibrate,Solid,Walking,"Walking is defined by an 'inverted pendulum' gait in which the body vaults over the stiff limb or limbs with each step. This applies regardless of the number of limbs - even arthropods with six, eight or more limbs."
Vibrate,Solid,Wheel and Axle,A simple torque multiplier consisting of a wheel turned by an axle (or an axle turned by a wheel)
