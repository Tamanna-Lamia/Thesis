Change,Brightness,Fresnel Lens,"A lens using less material compared to a conventional spherical lens by breaking the lens into a set of concentric annular sections. For each of these, the overall thickness of the lens is decreased, breaking the continuous surface of a standard lens into a set of surfaces of the same curvature, with discontinuities between them. This reduces the thickness (and weight and volume) of the lens, at the expense of reducing the imaging quality."

The resulting edgeward flow can carry nearly all the dispersed material to the edge.
Change,Colour,Colloid,"A type of chemical mixture where one substance is dispersed evenly throughout another. The particles of the dispersed substance are only suspended in the mixture, unlike a solution, where they are completely dissolved within.

Change,Colour,Colloidal Crystal,"A highly ordered array of particles which can be formed over a very long range (from a few millimeters to one centimeter) in length, and which appear analogous to their atomic or molecular counterparts. One of the finest natural examples of this phenomenon can be found in precious opal, where brilliant regions of pure spectral color result from close-packed domains of amorphous colloidal spheres of silicon dioxide (or silica)."

Change,Density,Salt Fingering,"A mixing process that occurs when relatively warm, salty water overlies relatively colder, fresher water. It is driven by the fact that heated water diffuses more readily than salty water. A small parcel of warm, salty water sinking downwards into a colder, fresher region will lose its heat before losing its salt, making the parcel of water increasingly denser than the water around it and sinking further. Likewise, a small parcel of colder, fresher water will be displaced upwards and gain heat by diffusion from surrounding water, which will then make it lighter than the surrounding waters, and cause it to rise further."
Change,Density,Settling,"The process by which particulates settle to the bottom of a liquid and form a sediment. Particles that experience a force, either due to gravity or due to centrifugal motion will tend to move in a uniform manner in the direction exerted by that force.

Change,Shape,Magnetostriction,A property of ferromagnetic materials that causes them to change their shape or dimensions during the process of magnetisation. The variation of material's magnetisation due to the applied magnetic field changes the magnetostrictive strain until reaching its saturation value. This effect can cause losses due to frictional heating in susceptible ferromagnetic cores.
Change,Shape,Memory Foam,"(visco-elastic polyurethane foam). Made from polyurethane with additional chemicals that increase its viscosity level, thereby increasing its density. Depending on the chemicals used and its overall density, it is firmer in cool temperatures and softer when warm.

A lower density memory foam is pressure-sensitive and will mould more quickly to the shape of the body."
Change,Shape,Negative Thermal Expansion,"A physicochemical process in which some materials contract upon heating rather than expanding as most materials do.

Change,Shape,Reaction (physics),"In classical mechanics, Newton's third law states that forces occur in pairs: the Action and the Reaction. Both forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. The distinction between action and reaction is purely arbitrary: any one of the two forces can be considered an action, in which case the other (corresponding) force automatically becomes its associated reaction."

Dispersion is most often described for light waves, but it may occur for any kind of wave that interacts with a medium or passes through an inhomogeneous geometry (e.g. a waveguide), such as sound waves."
Change,Sound,Doppler Effect,"The change in frequency and wavelength of a wave for an observer moving relative to the source of the waves. For waves that propagate in a medium, such as sound waves, the velocity of the observer and of the source are relative to the medium in which the waves are transmitted. The total Doppler effect may therefore result from motion of the source, motion of the observer, or motion of the medium."

Like an ordinary wave, it carries energy and can propagate through a medium (solid, liquid, gas or plasma) or through a field such as the electromagnetic field.

When the two sides are pressed together, the hooks catch in the loops and hold the pieces together. When the layers are separated, the strips make a characteristic 'ripping' sound."
Change,Sound,Vibrating String,"A vibrating string produces a sound whose frequency in most cases is constant. Therefore, since frequency characterizes the pitch, the sound produced is a constant note. Vibrating strings are the basis of any string instrument like guitar, cello, or piano."

Change,Speed,Coriolis Force,"An apparent deflection, or force, experienced by moving objects when viewed from a rotating frame of reference. The Coriolis force is an example of a fictitious force (or pseudo force), because it does not appear when the motion is expressed in an inertial frame of reference. For example, freely moving objects on the surface of the Earth experience a Coriolis force, and appear to veer to the right in the northern hemisphere, and to the left in the southern."

Used in some types of steam turbine, rocket engines and supersonic jet engines."
Change,Speed,Differential Windlass,"In a differential windlass (or Chinese windlass) there are two coaxial drums of different radii r and r'.

Responsible for commonly observed magnetism phenomena, e.g. 'fridge magnets. A material is 'ferromagnetic' only if all its magnetic ions add a positive contribution to the net magnetisation. If some of them subtract from the net magnetisation (i.e. are partially anti-aligned), then the material is 'ferrimagnetic'."

Change,Speed,Flywheel,"A mechanical device with significant moment of inertia used as a storage device for rotational energy. Flywheels resist changes in their rotational speed, which helps steady the rotation of the shaft when a fluctuating torque is exerted on it by its power source such as a piston-based (reciprocating) engine, or when the load placed on it is intermittent (such as a piston pump)."
Change,Speed,Force,"That which can cause an object with mass to accelerate. Force has both magnitude & direction, i.e. it's a vector quantity. An object with constant mass will accelerate in proportion to the net force acting upon it and in inverse proportion to its mass (or the net force on an object is equal to the rate of change of momentum it experiences). Forces acting on objects may cause them to rotate or deform, or result in a change in pressure."

It is driven by the fact that heated water diffuses more readily than salty water. A small parcel of warm, salty water sinking downwards into a colder, fresher region will lose its heat before losing its salt, making the parcel of water increasingly denser than the water around it and sinking further. Likewise, a small parcel of colder, fresher water will be displaced upwards and gain heat by diffusion from surrounding water, which will then make it lighter than the surrounding waters, and cause it to rise further."

Increase,Fluid Flow,Tesla Turbine,"(or boundary layer turbine, cohesion-type turbine or Prandtl layer turbine) A bladeless centrifugal flow turbine expander that uses the boundary layer effect and not a fluid impinging upon the blades as in a conventional turbine. Consists of a set of smooth disks, with nozzles applying a moving gas to the edge of the disk. The gases drag on the disk by viscosity and adhesion of the surface layer of the gas.

For example, lead zirconate titanate crystals will exhibit a maximum shape change of about 0.1% of the original dimension."
Increase,Force,Coriolis Force,"An apparent deflection, or force, experienced by moving objects when viewed from a rotating frame of reference. The Coriolis force is an example of a fictitious force (or pseudo force), because it does not appear when the motion is expressed in an inertial frame of reference.

In a non-Newtonian fluid, the relation between the shear stress and the strain rate is nonlinear, and can even be time-dependent. Therefore a constant coefficient of viscosity can not be defined.

Stabilise,Drag,Thixotropy,"The property of some non-Newtonian pseudoplastic fluids to show a time-dependent change in viscosity; the longer the fluid undergoes shear stress, the lower its viscosity.

Stabilise,Electrical Conductivity,Colloid,"A type of chemical mixture where one substance is dispersed evenly throughout another. The particles of the dispersed substance are only suspended in the mixture, unlike a solution, where they are completely dissolved within. This occurs because the particles in a colloid are larger than in a solution - small enough to be dispersed evenly and maintain a homogenous appearance, but large enough to scatter light and not dissolve."

Stabilise,Electrical Conductivity,Dielectric Permittivity,"The measure of how much resistance is encountered when forming an electric field in a medium. In other words, permittivity is a measure of how an electric field affects, and is affected by, a dielectric medium.
